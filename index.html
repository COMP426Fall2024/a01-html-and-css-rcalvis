            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The Eras Tour hits all of Taylor Swift's albums with the exception of her debut album. The tour has seen set list changes, 
                costume changes, surprise announcements, special guests, and more. Every show instantly sold out in what is known in the Swiftie 
                community as "The Great War" in reference to a song from her <em>Midnights</em> album.  Many fans were unable to purchase tickets 
                through Ticketmaster's website as Ticketmaster sold out every ticket during presale and did not save any for general sale. This 
                sparked national headlines and even caught the attention of government officials.

                Each concert is roughly three hours long with only short breaks (~3 minutes each) in between different sets. As of the end of the 
                European leg of the tour, Swift performs 46 songs from ten albums, including two surprise songs that are different for each show. 
                The acoustic set is arguably the most anticipated set of each show. This is when she performs her surprise songs: one on piano and 
                one on guitar. During the first US leg, Swift made a point to never repeat a surprise song from one show at a later show. Starting 
                in the South American leg of the tour, Swift started to do mashups of songs, meaning up to six different songs could be played as 
                surprise songs.

                Taylor Swift's record-breaking, earth-shattering "Eras Tour" has become the biggest tour pop culture has seen. Spanning across 
                almost two full years and six continents, the tour will be remembered as one of the greats. Let's take a closer look at the 
                tour.
