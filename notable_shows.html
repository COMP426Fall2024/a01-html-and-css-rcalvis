        <h4>March 17, 2023 - Glendale, AZ</h4>
        <p>
            The first Eras Tour show! Every song was a surprise song for that crowd. There had been very little information about the tour's 
            production and much speculation about which songs were going to be played. The crowd was left in amazement after over three amazing 
            hours of performance.

            Before singing the first surprise song during the acoustic set, Taylor announced that she had been planning something special for a 
            while and she was finally able to tell everyone about it. She asked the crowd to direct their attention to the screens where the cover 
            and release date for her highly anticipated re-recording <em>Speak Now (Taylor's Version)</em> appeared.

        <h4>August 9, 2023 - Los Angeles, CA</h4>
        <p>
            On the last night of the first US leg of the tour, before singing the first surprise song during the acoustic set, Taylor asked the 
            crowd to once again direct their attention to the screen for a special announcement. The screen displayed the cover and release date 
            for <em>1989 (Taylor's Version)</em>. There had been speculation of an announcement on this day as the date 8/9 resembled the 1989 title.

        <hr>
        <h4>May 9, 2024 - Paris, France</h4>
        <p>
            The first show after the release of THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT. The order of the sets was changed, new outfits were debuted for 
            almost every era, and a set for TTPD was added. Some songs were cut from the setlist and the <em>folklore</em> and <em>evermore</em> 
            eras were combined into one set.

            Taylor's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, joins her on stage during THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT set. During a transition between songs, he 
            carries her across the stage in his arms. Earlier in the TTPD set, Taylor Swift sings "So High School," confirmed to be about their 
            relationship.
