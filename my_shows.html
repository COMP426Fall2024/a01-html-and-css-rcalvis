            <h1>My Eras Tour Shows</h1>
            <p>
                I was lucky enoough to be able to purchase tickets for both Foxborough Night 3 in May of 2023 and Miami Night 3 in October of 
                2024. Going to the Eras Tour is truly an amazing experience and well worth the time, money, and effort spent preparing and traveling 
                for the concert.

            <h2>Foxborough, MA Night 2 - May 21, 2023</h2>
            <img width="300" src="https://www.gillettestadium.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-TaylorSwift-1200x800-1.jpg" alt="Poster for 
            Foxborough's three Eras Tour shows." title="Foxborough Tour Poster">
            <p>
                The Foxborough show featured Gracie Abrams and Phoebe Bridgers as openers. They played for around 1.5 hours combined before Taylor 
                came on stage. Having Phoebe Bridgers as my opener also meant that I got to hear "Nothing New" on the setlist. This was one of my 
                favorite songs to hear played live (although it is not one of my favorite songs) because Taylor Swift and Phoebe Bridgers' voices 
                work so well together and the live performance sounded very similar to the studio recording.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was happy to see that Taylor wore some of my favorite outfit variations during my show.

                The Foxborough N3 show had a different surprise song section than any other show on the Eras Tour. The night before, Taylor had 
                played her 3.5 hour in the pouring rain. During the surprise songs from the night before, her piano got damaged. When she began to 
                play the first chords of the piano surprise song during Night 3, the piano started to glitch and play notes she was not pressing. 
                Taylor decided to play the second surprise song on the guitar instead of the piano.
            </p>
            <h5>
                Important to note: Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, MA was the first stadium Taylor Swift ever played a concert at. Night 3 was her 
                13th time playing at Gillette Stadium. 13 is Taylor's lucky number.

            <h2>Miami, FL Night Three - October 20, 2024</h2>
            <img width="300" src="https://s34563.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TS24_600x400_ArtLockup_v1.jpg" alt="Poster for Miami's 
            three Eras Tour shows." title="Miami Eras Tour Poster">
            <p>
                The Miami shows of the Eras Tour will feature Gracie Abrams as the sole opener. When I saw Gracie Abrams open in May of 2023, I 
                did not know any of her songs. Since then, I have listened to some of her older songs as well as her new album that was released 
                in June of 2024. I know many of her songs now and am excited to see a longer set of her songs. Taylor Swift and Gracie Abrams also 
                had a collaboration on Abrams' new album that could potentially be played as a surprise song.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I bought tickets for an Eras Tour show in October of 2024, the setlist had not yet changed at all. I purchased the tickets in 
                July of 2023 and was just excited to be able to see the same songs performed again. However, there have been multiple setlist changes, 
                new outfit variations, and an entire new album full of potential surprise songs.
            </p>
            <h4>Major Eras Tour Changes Since Foxborough N3:</h4>
            <form>
                <select name="changes" size="5">
                    <option>Set order changes</option>
                    <option>Over 20 new outfit variations</option>
                    <option>Removal of six setlist songs</option>
                    <option>Addition of THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT set</option>
                    <option>Surprise song mashups</option>
                </select>
            </form>
            <p>
                Arguably the most highly anticipated set of the show is the acoustic set as the surprise songs change every night. There is an app, 
                Mastermind, where Swifties can guess which outfits Taylor will wear during a show and which surprise songs she will play that night. 
                The entrant with the highest score based off point values given to each correct answer can win prizes such as signed CDs, vinyls, and 
                merch. This keeps everyone in the Swiftie community interested in what is going on at each of the Eras Tour shows even though they are 
                not there.
